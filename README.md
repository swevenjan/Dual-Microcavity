# Dosimetric and Energy Deposition Evaluation of the Dual-Microcavity Capsule Structure for Glioma 125I Brachytherapy Using Monte Carlo Simulation
Codes and data for Nuclear Engineering and Technology journal 

## Overall Introduction
This project is divided into four experiments, namely dose rate constant determination, radial function measurement, anisotropy function measurement and energy deposition distribution experiment.

The complete experimental procedure will be uploaded after the paper is finally accepted.

Currently, the program uploads four types of Common source code.

Among them, the source code uses the CADMesh module.

## Model
The model used in the experiment can be provided by contacting the corresponding author via email. The model format is stl.

## Data
All data is contained in EXCEL, and this table is updated dynamically.
